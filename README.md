## Project Overview
Math for kids web application was created as a final project for CodeCore Developer Bootcamp. An idea behind it is simple,
make life of parents easier and help them with everyday math exercises for their children. Math for kids has two kind of users,
primary user - which is parent, and secondary user - a child whose account is created by a parent. Child is then able to access
application directly, using their account.

### Parent user
When you sign in as a parent, you can do several actions in Parent Page.
